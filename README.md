## Introduction
Just my effort to follow along with the tutorials at [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com), utilizing 
the C language instead of C++. 

## Why?
I am more familiar with C than C++ at the time of writing, so while I have followed the tutorials in C++,
I'd like to try them in C too since OpenGL is basically a C library. By adapting the example code from
LearnOpenGL to C's language constructs and available facilities, I learn more about both languages. Also,
I think it would be fun to do some graphics programming in C.

As I progress, I expect that my program will differ more and more from the examples shown at LearnOpenGL,
while still utilizing everything that is taught there to arrive at a similar result.
